When working with 3-year-olds, the science activities need to be simple, engaging, and sensory-driven. Here are some fun and easy science ideas that are age-appropriate for toddlers:

### 1. **Color Mixing with Water**
   - **What you need**: Clear cups, water, food coloring (red, yellow, blue), and a spoon.
   - **What to do**: Fill the cups with water and add a drop of food coloring to each cup. Then, let the child experiment by mixing different colored waters in a separate cup and watch what new colors they create.
   - **What kids learn**: Basic color mixing and the concept of cause and effect.

### 2. **Sink or Float**
   - **What you need**: A large bowl or container filled with water, various small objects (e.g., a rubber duck, a spoon, a rock, a piece of paper, a ball).
   - **What to do**: Have the child guess whether each object will sink or float before placing it in the water.
   - **What kids learn**: Basic concepts of buoyancy and density, and understanding which objects float or sink.

### 3. **Water Play with Sponges**
   - **What you need**: A shallow container, sponges, and water.
   - **What to do**: Give the child sponges to soak in the water and squeeze them out into another container. Talk about how the sponges absorb the water and how they release it when squeezed.
   - **What kids learn**: Absorption and simple concepts of how liquids can be stored and moved.

### 4. **Ice and Salt Experiment**
   - **What you need**: Ice cubes, a tray, salt, and a spoon.
   - **What to do**: Place some ice cubes on a tray and let the child sprinkle salt on them. Watch how the ice melts faster where the salt has been applied. You can also place a toy on the ice and see how long it takes to "free" the toy after sprinkling salt.
   - **What kids learn**: The effect of salt on ice (melting), and basic temperature changes.

### 5. **Bubble Fun (Air and Pressure)**
   - **What you need**: Bubble solution (or dish soap and water), a bubble wand.
   - **What to do**: Blow bubbles and let the child chase and pop them. You can even experiment with blowing bubbles in different shapes or sizes and let the child explore how they form and burst.
   - **What kids learn**: Air pressure, the concept of bubbles, and fun cause-and-effect interactions.

### 6. **Nature Walk and Collecting**
   - **What you need**: A small basket or bag, magnifying glass (optional).
   - **What to do**: Take the child on a nature walk and have them collect leaves, rocks, flowers, sticks, etc. Back at home, examine the items closely using the magnifying glass or just by looking closely at textures, shapes, and colors.
   - **What kids learn**: Observation, classification, and an introduction to natural elements.

### 7. **Shadows Play**
   - **What you need**: A flashlight or a lamp, a few toys or objects (preferably with interesting shapes).
   - **What to do**: In a darkened room, shine a light on different objects to create shadows. Move the objects closer or farther from the light to see how the shadow size changes. You can even play "shadow puppets" by using hands or toys.
   - **What kids learn**: Light, shadows, and how the position of an object affects its shadow.

### 8. **Planting Seeds**
   - **What you need**: Small pots, soil, seeds (e.g., sunflower or bean seeds), water.
   - **What to do**: Help the child plant seeds in small pots and water them daily. Talk about the changes that happen as the seed starts to grow. You can even take photos to show how the plant changes over time.
   - **What kids learn**: The basic life cycle of plants and the importance of water and sunlight.

### 9. **Making Playdough (Texture and Properties)**
   - **What you need**: Flour, salt, water, vegetable oil, and food coloring (optional).
   - **What to do**: Make homemade playdough together, exploring the changes in texture as you mix the ingredients. You can also add food coloring for extra fun. Once made, let the child create shapes and structures.
   - **What kids learn**: Mixing ingredients, textures, and basic properties of solids.

### 10. **Magnet Play**
   - **What you need**: A magnet, a variety of small objects (paper clips, coins, plastic toys, etc.).
   - **What to do**: Let the child explore which objects are attracted to the magnet and which are not. Create a simple sorting game where the child places magnetic items in one pile and non-magnetic items in another.
   - **What kids learn**: Basic magnetic properties and sorting objects by their characteristics.

### 11. **Water Color Exploration**
   - **What you need**: Clear containers, water, food coloring, or colored water.
   - **What to do**: Fill several containers with clear water, and add different colors to each one. Let the child explore how mixing the colored water creates new colors. You can also experiment by pouring water from one container to another.
   - **What kids learn**: Color mixing and exploration of liquid properties.

### 12. **Shaky Bottles (Vibrations and Sounds)**
   - **What you need**: Empty plastic bottle, rice, beads, or small items that make noise when shaken.
   - **What to do**: Fill the bottle with rice, beads, or other small items, then seal it tightly. Shake the bottle and let the child listen to the different sounds. You can also experiment by adding different materials to the bottle to see how the sound changes.
   - **What kids learn**: Sound, vibration, and cause and effect.

### 13. **Rain in a Jar (Condensation and Evaporation)**
   - **What you need**: A clear jar, hot water, ice cubes, a plate.
   - **What to do**: Pour hot water into the jar, and then place a plate with ice cubes on top of the jar. After a few minutes, water droplets will form on the inside of the jar, simulating rain. Discuss how the water in the air turns into droplets and "rains" down.
   - **What kids learn**: Basic concepts of condensation and evaporation.

These activities engage a toddlerâ€™s senses and curiosity, providing them with a fun introduction to basic science concepts while helping them develop observation skills, fine motor skills, and critical thinking. Always remember to supervise closely, as toddlers tend to explore with their hands and mouths!
